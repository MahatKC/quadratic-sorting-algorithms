# quadratic-sorting-algorithms

Project developed by  [@MahatKC](https://www.github.com/MahatKC), [@AmandaIsrael](https://www.github.com/AmandaIsrael) and [@igorFNegrizoli](https://www.github.com/igorFNegrizoli) in pair programming in 2022.

This project was an assignment for the Algorithm Analysis and Design course we took in our 4th year of Computer Science.

Coded entirely in Python, it compares three quadratic sorting algorithms in regards to their time cost: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort and Selection Sort.

Different sets of numbers with varying lengths were provided by the course's professor and used to compare each algorithm's efficiency.

Matplotlib and Pandas were used to create a CSV with the results of different runs and plot graphs comparing the runs.
